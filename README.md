# Day 1 — Hello Python

- Virtual env: `.venv`
- Scripts: `greet_user.py`
- How to run: `python greet_user.py`
# Day 2 — Calculator Agent

A tiny command-line calculator that supports:
- add, subtract, multiply, divide
- modulus `%` and power `**`
- safe number input (won’t crash on bad input)
- looped menu (do many calculations)
- `history` command (shows last 5 results)

## How to run

```bash
python calculator.py
Day 3 — Grade Checker:
- Built a Grade Checker script using if/elif/else and nested logic.
- Added input validation, clean function separation, and boundary tests.
- Learned program flow control and safe user input patterns.

# Day 4 — Loops

- Practiced for/while loops, break, continue
- Built `number_analyzer.py`: prints even/odd up to N
- Added input validation and summary counts for evens/odds
- (Optional) Added mode filter (all/evens/odds)

## How to run:

```bash
python number_analyzer.py
# Day 5 — Lists + Dictionaries

Today’s goals:
- Practiced **lists** (indexing, slicing, add/remove)
- Practiced **dictionaries** (keys, values, `.get()`)
- Built `contact_book.py` → **add / search / delete / show** contacts

## How to run

```bash
python contact_book.py
# Day 6 — Error Handling

- Practiced `try/except/finally`
- Learned common errors: `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `KeyError`
- Updated Calculator + Contact Book to handle user mistakes
- Programs no longer crash on bad input

**How to run:**
```bash
python calculator.py
python contact_book.py
