# Day 5 — Task Manager v2 (Collections + JSON)

## Overview
This day evolved the CLI Task Manager from v1 → v2 by adding:
- A **Manager class** to handle collections of Task objects.
- Full **CRUD cycle** (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- **JSON persistence** so data survives restarts.
- A clean **CLI** interface with autosave/autoload and input guardrails.

---

## Key Learnings
- **Encapsulation:** Classes can hide internal state (TaskManager manages all tasks).
- **Serialization:** JSON bridges in-memory data and disk persistence.
- **Defensive programming:** Guardrails prevent crashes on invalid input.
- **Clean architecture:** Model ↔ Manager ↔ CLI separation keeps the code modular and testable.
